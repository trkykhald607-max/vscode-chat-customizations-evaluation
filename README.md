q# Chat Customizations Evaluations

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An extension for analyzing and improving AI prompt files. Works with `.prompt.md`, `.agent.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `.instructions.md` files — providing LLM-powered semantic analysis directly in VS Code.

## Features

### LLM-Powered Analysis (via GitHub Copilot)

- **Contradiction Detection** — Finds logical, behavioral, and format conflicts
- **Semantic Ambiguity** — Ambiguity analysis with rewrite suggestions
- **Persona Consistency** — Detects conflicting personality traits and tone drift
- **Cognitive Load Assessment** — Warns about overly complex prompts with too many nested conditions
- **Semantic Coverage** — Identifies gaps in intent handling and missing error paths
- **Composition Conflict Analysis** — Detects conflicts between a prompt and other prompt files it imports via markdown links

### Waza Integration

- **Create Eval Scaffold** — Generates eval files for a skill via `waza new eval <skill-name>`
- **Run Evaluation** — Executes skill evaluation via `waza run <eval.yaml> --context-dir <skill-dir>`
- **Automatic Local Fallback** — If `waza` is not on `PATH`, commands attempt a local fallback via `go run ./cmd/waza` when a sibling `waza` repo is available

### Editor Integration

- **Editor Title Bar** — Analyze Prompt button appears when editing prompt files
- **Command Palette** — `Chat Customizations Evaluations: Analyze Prompt` command
- **Problems Panel** — All diagnostics appear in the standard VS Code Problems panel with precise line and column locations

## Supported File Types

| Pattern | Type |
|---|---|
| `*.prompt.md` | Prompt |
| `*.agent.md` | Agent |
| `*.instructions.md` | Instructions |

## Usage

1. Open any supported prompt file in VS Code
2. Run **Chat Customizations Evaluations: Analyze Prompt** from the command palette or click the beaker icon in the editor title bar
3. View results in the **Problems panel** (`Ctrl+Shift+M` / `Cmd+Shift+M`)

LLM analysis requires **GitHub Copilot** — no API keys needed. Just sign in to GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Chat Customizations Evaluations: Analyze Prompt` | Run full LLM-powered analysis on the active file |
| `Chat Customizations Evaluations: Create Waza Eval Scaffold` | Create `eval.yaml` and task files for the active skill |
| `Chat Customizations Evaluations: Run Waza Evaluation` | Run the skill's eval suite |
| `Chat Customizations Evaluations: Download Waza Binary` | Download the latest platform-specific waza binary and configure the extension to use it |
| `Chat Customizations Evaluations: Open Analysis and Fix User Guide` | Open the analysis and fix workflow guide |

- [Waza User Guide](docs/WAZA-USER-GUIDE.md)

### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `chatCustomizationsEvaluations.enable` | `true` | Enable/disable the extension |
| `chatCustomizationsEvaluations.trace.server` | `off` | Trace communication between VS Code and the language server |
| `chatCustomizationsEvaluations.customDiagnostics` | `[]` | Array of custom diagnostic objects with `name` and `description` fields |
| `chatCustomizationsEvaluations.waza.command` | `waza` | Command used to run waza (for example `/usr/local/bin/waza`) |

### Telemetry

The extension now emits usage telemetry events for activation, analysis commands, diagnostics fixes, and waza workflows.

- Telemetry is gated by VS Code telemetry settings.
- Events only include coarse metadata (for example counts, durations, and success/failure outcomes).
- File contents, prompt text, and file paths are not sent in telemetry event payloads.

To export telemetry to your own collector, set these environment variables before launching VS Code:

- `CHAT_CUSTOMIZATIONS_EVALUATIONS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`: HTTPS endpoint that accepts JSON POST payloads.
- `CHAT_CUSTOMIZATIONS_EVALUATIONS_TELEMETRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Optional bearer token added as the `Authorization` header.
